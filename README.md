# Xena
Lean Library currently studying for a degree at Imperial College 

# About

This is a collection of files written by Kevin Buzzard and some of his
students. Kevin Buzzard is the lecturer for the "M1F" course at Imperial,
which is the standard introduction to proof course which runs at many
UK universities. The official name of the course is "foundations of
analysis" although there are other things in there too.

The M1F course was designed by Martin Liebeck
and it is based on his book "A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics",
published by Chapman & Hall.

Current student contributors in alphabetical order:

Ellen Arlt
Tudor Ciurca
Chris Hughes
Kenny Lau
Julian Wykowski

The files are mostly written in a computer language called Lean.
Lean is an automated proof checker. You can find more information about Lean at

https://leanprover.github.io/

Basically, Lean can understand mathematics, and can check that it
doesn't have any mistakes in. Most of the files here are Lean verifications
of various pieces of undergraduate level mathematics.

Some of the lean files are in a library called Xena. One could imagine Xena
as currently studying mathematics at Imperial College London. To find out more
about her, you could check out her blog at

Vague long term goals:

1) Get many of the example sheet questions and solutions typed up in Lean
and into a Lean problem bank, hosted here.

2) Type up Lean versions of all the theorems and proofs in the course.

3) Make an "M1F tactic" which attempts M1F problem sheet questions.
